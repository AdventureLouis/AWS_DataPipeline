# Outputs are now defined directly in main.tf for simplicity
# This file is kept for backward compatibility but is no longer required

# Note: All outputs have been moved to main.tf to follow
# Guido van Rossum's principle of keeping related code together
# and to provide a comprehensive pipeline summary
